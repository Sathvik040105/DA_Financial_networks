# Community Detection in Financial Networks Using Stochastic Block Model  

## Community detection in Trade Data
### Overview

This project analyzes international trade relationships using network analysis and community detection algorithms to identify trading blocs and patterns.

The code implements:
- Country name standardization between different data sources
- Network analysis of international trade relationships
- Community detection using the Weighted Stochastic Block Model (WSBM)
- Visualization of trade communities and network structure

## Community Detection in Indian Stock Data ( NIFTY 150 )
### Overview

This project analyzes the relationships between stocks in India's NIFTY 150 index using network analysis and community detection techniques. The analysis includes correlation-based edge weights and identifies trading communities using the Weighted Stochastic Block Model (WSBM).

### Key Features
- Correlation network construction from stock price data
- Community detection using WSBM
- Interactive network visualization
- Hierarchical clustering analysis

### Data Processing
1. Data Collection
   - Stock data for NIFTY 150 companies from yfinance
   - Cleaning and preprocessing time series data
   - Computing pairwise correlations

2. Network Construction
   - Edge weights based on stock price correlations
   - Threshold filtering for significant relationships
   - Network normalization techniques

3. Community Detection
   - Implementation of WSBM algorithm
   - Parameter optimization for community detection
   - Validation of community structures

### Visualizations
1. Network Graph
   - Color-coded communities
   - Edge weights showing correlation strength
   - Interactive spring layout
   - Node labels for stock identification

2. Hierarchical Clustering
   - Dendrogram visualization
   - Distance-based clustering
   - Community relationship analysis
